Student hours - Spring 2020
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Student hours (some call them "office hours") are Monday and Wednesday, 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM and 2 PM to 3:30 PM. Walk-ins are welcome but students who `make an appointment <https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/15min>`_  take precedence. My office is in **Doyle 207**. I am also available via Zoom and Google Hangouts (video conferencing).
