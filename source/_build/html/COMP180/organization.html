<p>The course is an introduction to data science and visualization techniques, using Python. Students are expected to have a solid understanding of the basic properties of functions, with emphasis on polynomial functions, including linear and quadratic functions; Computing real and complex roots of polynomials; rational functions, absolute value functions, and inverse functions; and solutions of systems of equations. This is accomplished by having completed MATH 117 at LUC, or a similar course elsewhere.</p>
<p>As part of the course we’ll cover matrix algebra, probabilities and statistics. Therefore, familiarity with the mathematical concepts in the paragraph above is essential. <strong>There will be a series of in-class assignments the first week of the term, to assess that you have the prerequisite background to succeed in the course.</strong></p>
<p>This is an inherently programming-based course. We will use Python to conduct data analytics experiments and visualization. You don’t have to know the language coming into the course, but you are expected to know <em>some</em> programming that will allow you to learn Python as you go along.</p>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h3>Textbook<a class="headerlink" href="#textbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is no required textbook for this course. Reading material will be posted online as needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="computer-equipment">
<h3>Computer Equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#computer-equipment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You will also need access to a computer (laptop or desktop) where you can install the Anaconda navigator. The computers in the classroom, as well as those in the <em>Information Commons</em> are equipped with a plain version of Anaconda that is sufficient for the early part of the course; however as the course progresses we’ll need more advanced tools that are not available on the classroom’s computers.</p>

<h2>Ground rules<a class="headerlink" href="#ground-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="be-proactive">
<h3>Be proactive<a class="headerlink" href="#be-proactive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In my experience, the single most common cause of poor performance in any course is when students are not proactive. When you are proactive you can recognize and address any issues with your courses. And learning to be proactive is one of the most valuable skills you can aquire in college.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can be proactive, so you can succeed in this coure.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Review homework (or other take-home tests) within 24 hours of assignment. Identify questions that may be challenging. Seek tutoring to work over these questions. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/">The Department of Computer Science offers tutorting services almost on a daily basis.</a></p></li>
<li><p>A grade of less than 50% in any assignment, is a warning sign. Compare your solution to the published solution. Try to identify the differences. Speak with a tutor if the differences are not clear.</p></li>
<li><p>Come to class and take notes. Form or join a study group comprising fellow students.</p></li>
<li><p>If, for any reason, you need to be absent from class, let me know in advance. I don’t need to know the reason, but I need to know about the duration of your absense.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grading-scheme">
<h3>Grading scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-scheme" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Course performance is determined using weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 33.33% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure <strong>that students are learning.</strong> In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deadlines">
<h3>Deadlines<a class="headerlink" href="#deadlines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Late submissions will not be accepted. Students are responsible for the timely return of homework and exam assignments. This responsibility requires students to notify the instructor in advance if they anticipate that they may not return an assigment by its stated deadline.</p>
<p><em>Bona fide</em> emergencies are, of course, exempt from this rule. Students dealing with an emergency should take care of it first and notify the instructor when time and obligations permit.</p>
<p>Homework, midterm, and final assignments are due one week after assigned. These assignments should be returned via Sakai.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exam-dates">
<h3>Exam dates<a class="headerlink" href="#exam-dates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The final exam will be a take-home assignment. It will become available on Sakai at #:## PM on 4/##/20 and due at #:## PM on Monday 4/##/20 (subject to change).</p>
<p>The midterm exam will be a take-home assignment. It will become available on Sakai at 1 PM on 2/21/20 and due at 1 PM on Friday 2/28/20 (subject to change).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="student-hours-spring-2020">
<h3>Student hours - Spring 2020<a class="headerlink" href="#student-hours-spring-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Student hours (some call them “office hours”) are Monday and Wednesday, 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM and 2 PM to 3:30 PM. Walk-ins are welcome but students who <a class="reference external" href="https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/15min">make an appointment</a>  take precedence. My office is in <strong>Doyle 207</strong>. I am also available via Zoom and Google Hangouts (video conferencing).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h3>Academic integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students are expected and encouraged to work together. It is also expected that students will explore the vastness of the internet to discover information, knowledge, and solutions to problems. I consider all that to be part of your learning experience. It is up to you, however, to demonstrate your learning.</p>
<p>In practical terms this means that you should be able to describe in your own words how a piece of code works or how you arrived to a mathematical derivation, etc. Failure to do so will affect your course performance and, ultimately, your grade. It may also raise concerns related to academic integrity. <em>Verbatim</em> use of material obtained from others is considered a violation of the university’s policies for academic integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="professionalism">
<h3>Professionalism<a class="headerlink" href="#professionalism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In additional to the technical content of the course, there is a professional element to it. The professional element of the course is meant to cultivate your <strong>soft skills.</strong> These skills are highly sought after by employers. Soft skills include communication skills, neatness, punctuality, dependability, ability to work in teams, problem solving skills, etc.</p>
<p>In the context of this course, professionalis and soft skills are as follows.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be clear in your communications. When sending an email, make sure that it has an opening, an objective, and a closing.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The opening is a greeting line. “Hey” is never an approrpriate opening in professional communincations.</p></li>
<li><p>The objective is the main part of your email. Be precise and concise. For example, instead of writing “may I ask a question”, just ask the question.</p></li>
<li><p>The closing is a statement as to what you would like the other party to do in response to your message.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be respectful of others’ time. Here’re two examples:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Come to meetings (class, student (aka office) hours, study groups, tutoring, etc) <strong>prepared.</strong> If the meeting is about reviewing your code, make sure that your laptop is sufficiently charged, the computer is turned on, and the code is already loaded into some editor. Do not spend 5 minutes in the meeting finding a power outlet, turning on and booting the computer, and firing up an editor.</p></li>
<li><p>When in group meeting (e.g., class, study group, etc) keep your questions relevent to the objective of the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>When making an appointment and you realize that you cannot attend the meeting, notify the other party as soon as possible.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be organized and neat.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>When turning in homework or other assignments, make sure that your writing is legible and the overall appearance reflects quality and care. Content is always the most critical aspect of your work; but appearance counts too.</p></li>
<li><p>When submitting code, make sure the files are properly named. For example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">homework.java</span></code> may make sense on your side of the shop, but from the grader’s perspective it’s not very helpful. Instead, give your file a unique name that identifies it back to you, e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">JaneDoe-homework-2.java</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="zoom">
<h3>Zoom<a class="headerlink" href="#zoom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You need to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.luc.edu/its/itrs/teachingwithtechnology/zoom/">download and install Zoom</a> to your mobile device or laptop. Zoom is the University’s preferred tool for videoconferencing. In case of inclement weather or travel delays that prevent us from meeting on campus, we’ll use Zoom for an online class session. You can also use Zoom to meet with me during Student Hours, if one of us is not on campus.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="formal-stuff">
<h2>Formal stuff<a class="headerlink" href="#formal-stuff" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/academics/schedules">university’s official Academic Calendar</a></p></li>
<li><p>Every effort is made in this course to use open source, freely available material. However materials from the course cannot be shared outside the course without the instructor’s <em>written permission.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Duty to report.</strong> Faculty and staff of the University have a mandated responsibility to report any incidents of gender-based misconduct that they are made aware of, even if it happened in the past. Gender-based misconduct includes discrimination based on actual or perceived sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or pregnancy or parenting status; dating and domestic violence; sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and sexual exploitation); and stalking.</p></li>
