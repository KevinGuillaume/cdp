Ground rules
------------

Be proactive
++++++++++++
In my experience, the single most common cause of poor performance in any course is when students are not proactive. When you are proactive you can recognize and address any issues with your courses. And learning to be proactive is one of the most valuable skills you can aquire in college. 

Here's how you can be proactive, so you can succeed in this coure.

* Review homework (or other take-home tests) within 24 hours of assignment. Identify questions that may be challenging. Seek tutoring to work over these questions. `The Department of Computer Science offers tutorting services almost on a daily basis. <https://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/>`_

* A grade of less than 50% in any assignment, is a warning sign. Compare your solution to the published solution. Try to identify the differences. Speak with a tutor if the differences are not clear.

* Come to class and take notes. Form or join a study group comprising fellow students.

* If, for any reason, you need to be absent from class, let me know in advance. I don't need to know the reason, but I need to know about the duration of your absense.

Grading scheme
++++++++++++++

Course performance is determined using in-class assignments, weekly homework, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final. Each assessment component carries a 25% weight. Grading scheme aside, the objective of assessments in this course is to ensure **that students are learning.** In this context students make mistakes, understand them, and do not repeat them.

Deadlines
+++++++++

Late submissions will not be accepted. Students are responsible for the timely return of homework and exam assignments. This responsibility requires students to notify the instructor in advance if they anticipate that they may not return an assigment by its stated deadline. 

*Bona fide* emergencies are, of course, exempt from this rule. Students dealing with an emergency should take care of it first and notify the instructor when time and obligations permit.

Homework, midterm, and final assignments are due one week after assigned. These assignments should be returned via Sakai. 

For in-class assignments, students will have 20-30 minutes to complete them at the end of class session. For consistency, **in-class assignments will be held on Wednesday.** There will be about 6 in-class assignments. Students will not be penalized for missing up to 2 of these assignments.

Exam dates
++++++++++
The final exam will be a take-home assignment. It will become available on Sakai at 4:15 PM on 4/20/20 and due at 4:15 PM on Monday 4/27/20 (subject to change).

The midterm exam will be a take-home assignment. It will become available on Sakai at 4:15 PM on 2/21/20 and due at 4:15 PM on Friday 4/28/20 (subject to change).



Student hours
+++++++++++++

Student hours (some call them "office hours") are Monday and Wednesday, 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM and 2 PM to 3:30 PM. Walk-ins are welcome but students who `make an appointment <https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/15min>`_  take precedence. |myOffice|. I am also available via Zoom and Google Hangouts (video conferencing).

Academic integrity
++++++++++++++++++

Students are expected and encouraged to work together. It is also expected that students will explore the vastness of the internet to discover information, knowledge, and solutions to problems. I consider all that to be part of your learning experience. It is up to you, however, to demonstrate your learning. 

In practical terms this means that you should be able to describe in your own words how a piece of code works or how you arrived to a mathematical derivation, etc. Failure to do so will affect your course performance and, ultimately, your grade. It may also raise concerns related to academic integrity. * Verbatim use of material obtained from others is considered a violation of the university's policies for academic integrit

Formal stuff
------------

* The `university's official Academic Calendar <http://www.luc.edu/academics/schedules>`_

* Every effort is made in this course to use open source, freely available material. However materials from the course cannot be shared outside the course without the instructorâ€™s *written permission.* 

* **Duty to report.** Faculty and staff of the University have a mandated responsibility to report any incidents of gender-based misconduct that they are made aware of, even if it happened in the past. Gender-based misconduct includes discrimination based on actual or perceived sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or pregnancy or parenting status; dating and domestic violence; sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and sexual exploitation); and stalking.
