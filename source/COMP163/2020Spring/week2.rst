Review of Week 1 and Week 2
=======================================================

During the first two weeks of the course we talked about the fundamentals of sets. A *set* is a collection of distinct objects. For example the colors *red, green,* and *blue*, together form the set :math:`C=\{\text{red},\text{green},\text{blue}\}`. A set can also be defined in *set-builder* notation:

.. math::

   B = \{ x|x^2-4=0\}

The notation above means that :math:`B` is a set with two elements only: :math:`\{-2,2\}`.

Sets can also be denoted by pattern, e.g., :math:`A=\{1,3,5,\ldots, 1001\}` implies a set of odd numbers from  1 to 1001.

A very important property of a set is its *cardinality*. The cardinality is the size of the set, a number that tells us how many elements are in the set. For the sets in the previous examples, the cardinalities are:

.. math::

   |C|&=3 \\
   |B|&=2 \\
   |A|&=501
   
We also talked about set operations, focusing on the following three.

Set union
---------

The union of two sets is a set that contains all their elements. For example, if :math:`S=\{1,3,5\}` and :math:`T=\{2,4\}`, their union :math:`S\cup T` is the set :math:`\{1,2,3,4,5\}`.
